"""specback source-map v2 — layer 2: per-language extractor registry.

Each language gets one extractor (a subclass of ``Extractor``) registered here.
M0 ships an EMPTY registry: the three-layer skeleton runs end to end, but any
file whose language has no registered extractor falls back to a coarse
file-level unit and a loud warning (no silent exclusion — P4 in the design).

M2 adds TypeScript, M3 adds Python, etc. Real extractors use tree-sitter and are
the only place that pulls the tree-sitter dependency in, keeping M0 dependency
free.
